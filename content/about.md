Hi, I'm Jonathan, a second-year computer science student at the University of Ottawa. I enjoy nature, swimming,
 cross-country skiing and water skiing. Oh, and of course, I love learning about pretty much anything related to 
mathematics, science, or technology.

Here is where you can find me online:
