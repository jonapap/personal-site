I’m a student from the University of Ottawa, currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Physics. I’m originally from a small town in Northern Ontario, and I’m fully bilingual in French and English. My interests and past-times include swimming, cross-country skiing, water skiing, piano, reading, and being involved in the UORocketry team. Oh, and of course, I love learning about pretty much anything related to mathematics, science, and technology.

Here is where you can find me online:
