# Personal Site
A personal website built using Hugo and HTML5UP's Dimension theme. At the time of writing, Netlify is the hosting provider.

## How To Use
If for some reason you want to see this site on your own computer, it couldn't be any simpler. First, clone this repo and install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Hugo is a static site generator and needs to be installed to build the above code into a working website.
Next, navigate to the folder and run the following command:
```bash
hugo serve
```

And you are done! A local webserver should have been started and you should be able to open it in you browser.
